# Sensitivity to Calibrated Parameters

This repository contains the replication files for the paper "Sensitivity to Calibration" by Thomas H. JÃ¸rgensen. 
The paper can be found [here](https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/CWP1620-Sensitivity-to-Calibrated-Parameters.pdf).

The replication package contains two folders. 
+ "GP2002" contains all code for replication of the analysis in Gourinchas and Parker (2002).
+ "Oswald" conatins all code for the sensitivity analysis of the study by Oswald (2019).

## The Sensitivity Measure
See the notebook "Framework" for a description of the sensitivity measure and the estimation framework consideret.
